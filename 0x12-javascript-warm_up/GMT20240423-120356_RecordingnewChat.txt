00:46:38	Daniel Zongo(Abuja, Nigeria):	On my intranet, I am not seeing a server. Its empty. What do I do?
00:47:05	somin:	have the same quiz
00:48:59	MongeziS:	No Severs show on my intranet
00:49:48	somin:	how can I activate it ?
00:55:47	Abdelrhman Hany:	do we need to add it to the session? probably using ssh-add?
00:55:48	Collins Kim:	different key location
00:55:55	Charity Nyamamba:	we used the new ip right?
00:56:00	Eric:	the server is still running in the backgound
00:56:20	somin:	request another server?
00:56:31	1 Eseoghene ODODO:	I believe the private key school should be in the ~/.ssh/folder
00:56:48	Firaol:	we just change the path to ssh private key
00:58:31	Abdelrhman Hany:	you need the key to have permissions of 600 so probably run chmod to change the permissions to 600
01:02:03	Firaol:	owner can read and write but others can't do anything
01:02:04	Abdelrhman Hany:	this means read and write permissions for the owner user
01:02:12	Abdelrhman Hany:	and no permissions for the group and all
01:02:13	1 Eseoghene ODODO:	rw- ower
01:02:25	Bravin Onwonga:	owner r, w. other users and groups can't read, write or execute
01:02:48	1 Eseoghene ODODO:	0 - group0 - others
01:03:11	Abdelrhman Hany:	owner can read only
01:03:31	Abdelrhman Hany:	its rwx (4,2,1)
01:03:53	Abdelrhman Hany:	6 means r + w (4 + 2)
01:06:00	Abdelrhman Hany:	ufw
01:08:31	Bravin Onwonga:	A section of your screen is not visible?
01:08:36	Ahmed Hesham:	it's not clear
01:08:44	Mahmoud Ragab Fouad Abo3mira:	YES
01:10:21	somin:	yes
01:10:30	Ahmed Hesham:	there is a section that is not clear from the terminal
01:11:08	Ahmed Hesham:	fine it's fixed now
01:12:24	Bravin Onwonga:	How soon will the recording be ready?
01:14:24	Abdelrhman Hany:	no Ihaven't experienced it
01:14:34	Ahmed Hesham:	no
01:14:54	Abdelrhman Hany:	wait is it caused by a firewall on the server blocking port 22?
01:15:18	Abdelrhman Hany:	there's no turn around but to request a new server?
01:17:31	Charity Nyamamba:	sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP' found this command from digital ocean and thought it enables port80
01:18:00	Charity Nyamamba:	but still has the port80 connection refused error
01:18:45	Ahmed Hesham:	you're using wrong ip
01:18:49	Firaol:	that is not current ip
01:18:55	Abdelrhman Hany:	the ip is wrong
01:19:58	Abdelrhman Hany:	it's inconsistent xD
01:20:08	Abdelrhman Hany:	it's weird that it gave error before finally connecting
01:20:46	Charity Nyamamba:	sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP' found this command from digital ocean and thought it enables port80,but still has the port80 connection refused error
01:22:08	Abdelrhman Hany:	I have a question that, since the sandbox is a server with its ip, why can't I install NGINX on the sandbox and configure it as a web server?
01:22:25	Abdelrhman Hany:	that idea was so confusing to me and I need more explanation on that topic, thank you ^^
01:22:53	Abdelrhman Hany:	like what's the difference between the sandboxes and the servers were working with now?
01:24:18	Mohamed Rabiaa:	Hi, I can't access my student pack
01:29:33	Abdelrhman Hany:	I have a question that, since the sandbox is a server with its ip, why can't I install NGINX on the sandbox and configure it as a web server?that idea was so confusing to me and I need more explanation on that topic, thank you ^^
01:34:07	Abdelrhman Hany:	Oh wow that's new
01:34:43	Abdelrhman Hany:	no you need to run the apt update
01:37:18	1 Eseoghene ODODO:	Pls how did you install nginx?
01:37:46	Ahmed Hesham:	yes please repeat it again
01:58:56	Abdelrhman Hany:	yes we do
01:59:05	Abdelrhman Hany:	I configured it properly :D
02:03:23	Abdelrhman Hany:	no all good :D
02:11:50	Wally:	Sorry to interrupt, but i keep getting

02:46:51	Ebube:	I installed and tried to use the `tldr` command and it just tells me "no entry" for most commands I try... I don't know if I did something wrong
02:47:46	Ebube:	yes, I tried for ls, pwd, cd awk & sed... It didn't work
02:48:08	Charity Nyamamba:	sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP' found this command from digital ocean and thought it enables port80,but still has the port80 connection refused error
02:50:45	Ebube:	okay... It didn't do this when I tried... I'll uninstall the package and reinstall it
02:50:51	Ebube:	Thank you
